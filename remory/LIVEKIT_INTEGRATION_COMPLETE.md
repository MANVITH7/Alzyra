# LiveKit AI Agent Integration - Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

The LiveKit AI agent has been successfully integrated into the React Native app, specifically connected to the **"Reconstruct a Memory"** button in the PatientDashboard.

## How It Works

### 1. When the User Clicks the Button

When a patient clicks the **"Reconstruct a Memory"** button in the PatientDashboard:

1. **First Click (Connect)**:
   - Generates a unique LiveKit token for the patient
   - Connects to the LiveKit room
   - Automatically enables the microphone for voice interaction
   - Button changes to green with "✓ Connected to AI Agent"

2. **Second Click (While Connected)**:
   - Shows an option to disconnect from the agent
   - User can choose to stay connected or disconnect

### 2. Voice Interaction

Once connected:
- **User's microphone is active** - Patient can speak naturally to the AI agent
- **Agent responds with voice** - The AI agent speaks back using TTS
- **Real-time conversation** - Natural voice interaction for memory reconstruction

### 3. Visual Feedback

- **Button state**: Changes color to green when connected
- **Status message**: Shows microphone status and connection info
- **Conversation history**: Last 3 messages displayed in the conversation box
- **Real-time updates**: Connection state and messages update automatically

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`remory/components/PatientDashboard.js`**
   - Added `useLiveKit` hook integration
   - Updated `handleReconstructMemory` to connect/disconnect from agent
   - Added visual feedback for connection status
   - Added conversation display

2. **`remory/contexts/LiveKitContext.js`**
   - Added automatic microphone enabling on connection
   - Added TrackSubscribed event handler for agent audio
   - Improved connection state management

3. **`remory/services/livekitService.js`**
   - Implemented token generation using `livekit-server-sdk`
   - Configured to work with development environment

4. **`remory/App.js`**
   - Wrapped app with `LiveKitProvider` for global state

### Key Features

- ✅ **Automatic microphone enabling** - Voice ready immediately
- ✅ **Real-time voice interaction** - Two-way audio communication
- ✅ **Visual status indicators** - Clear connection feedback
- ✅ **Message history** - Shows recent conversation
- ✅ **Easy disconnect** - One-click disconnection option

## User Flow

```
Patient opens dashboard
    ↓
Clicks "Reconstruct a Memory" button
    ↓
Connects to AI agent automatically
    ↓
Microphone activates
    ↓
Patient speaks to agent
    ↓
Agent responds with voice
    ↓
Real-time conversation for memory help
```

## Testing the Integration

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure the LiveKit agent is running:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/manvithreddy/Downloads/Alzyra/alzyra
   uv run python src/agent.py dev
   ```

2. Make sure the React Native app is running:
   ```bash
   cd remory
   npx expo start
   ```

### Test Steps

1. Log in as a patient
2. Navigate to the Patient Dashboard
3. Click the **"Reconstruct a Memory"** button
4. Wait for connection confirmation
5. Speak naturally to the AI agent
6. Agent will respond with voice
7. Check the conversation messages below
8. Click the button again to disconnect

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not responding

- Check that agent is running in `dev` mode
- Verify `.env` has correct LiveKit credentials
- Check console for connection errors

### No audio from agent

- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check that audio tracks are being subscribed
- Look for TrackSubscribed console logs

### Connection timeout

- Verify LiveKit server URL is correct
- Check internet connection
- Ensure agent is running in `dev` mode (not `console`)

## Next Steps

The integration is complete and ready to use! Additional enhancements could include:

1. **Custom agent prompts** - Modify the agent's personality in `alzyra/src/agent.py`
2. **Memory-specific logic** - Add custom tools for memory reconstruction
3. **Recording transcripts** - Save conversations for later review
4. **Visual indicators** - Add waveform or speaking indicators
5. **Push-to-talk** - Add button for microphone control

## Summary

The LiveKit AI agent is now fully integrated and working. When patients click the **"Reconstruct a Memory"** button, they can immediately start having natural voice conversations with the AI assistant to help with memory reconstruction. The integration handles connection, audio, and visual feedback automatically.
