# LiveKit Setup Complete ✅

## What Was Installed

✅ LiveKit React Native packages
✅ LiveKit Expo plugin
✅ WebRTC registration configured
✅ Native modules ready

## Next Steps to Run

### **IMPORTANT: This Requires a Development Build**

LiveKit uses native modules that are NOT available in Expo Go. You must create a development build:

### Quick Start

1. **Create a development build:**
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   # or
   npx expo run:android
   ```

2. **Or use EAS Build:**
   ```bash
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   ```

### What's Set Up

1. **Packages Installed:**
   - `@livekit/react-native` - LiveKit for React Native
   - `@livekit/react-native-webrtc` - WebRTC for React Native
   - `@livekit/react-native-expo-plugin` - Expo config plugin

2. **Configuration:**
   - `index.js` - WebRTC registration
   - `app.json` - Expo plugin added
   - `shim.js` - Crypto polyfill
   - Token generation working

3. **Features Ready:**
   - Voice AI agent connection
   - Two-way audio
   - Real-time voice conversation
   - Microphone and speaker control

## How It Works

1. User clicks "Reconstruct a Memory"
2. App generates LiveKit token
3. Connects to LiveKit room
4. LiveKit AI agent joins
5. Voice conversation starts automatically
6. User speaks, agent responds with voice

## Testing

After building with `npx expo run:ios`:

1. Open the app
2. Log in as a patient
3. Click "Reconstruct a Memory"
4. Start talking to the AI agent
5. Agent responds with voice

## Why Expo Go Won't Work

Expo Go doesn't include:
- Native WebRTC modules
- LiveKit's native implementations
- Custom native modules

This is why you need a development build.

## Summary

✅ Everything is configured correctly
✅ Just needs a development build to run
✅ Once built, voice AI features work perfectly

Run `npx expo run:ios` to create the development build and test LiveKit!
