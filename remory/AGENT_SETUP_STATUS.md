## 🎯 How It Works When You Click the Button

### When User Clicks "Reconstruct a Memory":

1. **Room Creation** 📍
   - Creates unique room: `patient-{username}-{timestamp}`
   - Example: `patient-John-1234567890`

2. **Token Generation** 🔐
   - Generates LiveKit access token with room permissions
   - Includes user identity and permissions

3. **Connection** 🔌
   - Connects to LiveKit Cloud via WebRTC
   - Establishes peer-to-peer connection

4. **Agent Dispatch** 🤖
   - LiveKit automatically dispatches your deployed agent
   - Agent joins the room with `kind='agent'`

5. **Audio Setup** 🎤
   - Enables user's microphone automatically
   - Subscribes to agent's audio track
   - Starts bidirectional voice communication

6. **Ready State** ✅
   - Shows "AI Assistant Active" in UI
   - Displays agent state (initializing → listening → thinking → speaking)
   - User can speak naturally to the agent

## 🧪 Testing the Agent

### Expected Flow:

1. **Click "Reconstruct a Memory"**
   - Alert: "Connecting to AI Agent..."
   
2. **Connection** (2-3 seconds)
   - Status changes to "Connected"
   - Shows "AI Assistant Active"
   
3. **Agent State: `initializing`**
   - Agent is starting up
   
4. **Agent State: `listening`**
   - Agent is ready and waiting for user to speak
   
5. **User Speaks**
   - Say: "Can you help me remember my lunch with Sarah?"
   
6. **Agent State: `thinking`**
   - Processing your request
   
7. **Agent State: `speaking`**
   - Agent responds with voice
   - You hear the response through your phone speakers
   
8. **Repeat**
   - Continue conversation naturally

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Agent doesn't connect
**Solution**: Check that agent is deployed
```bash
cd alzyra
lk agent list  # Should show CA_Y3NE2BFqHF8J
```

### Issue: No audio from agent
**Solution**: 
1. Check microphone permissions
2. Verify agent is deployed
3. Check LiveKit Cloud dashboard for errors

### Issue: Agent state stuck on "initializing"
**Solution**:
1. Check agent logs in LiveKit Cloud
2. Verify OpenAI API key is set in agent `.env`
3. Check internet connection
